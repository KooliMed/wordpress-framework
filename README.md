Framework to create advanced plugins for wordpress on the go
Creating advanced plugins for WordPress sometimes takes a few days, especially when certain tasks are repeated almost every time. From there, the idea arose to help a team of WordPress developers progress faster by creating a framework with essential functions. The framework creates a settings page and makes adding new settings extremely simple. It automatically adds new plugin administration pages and assigns them a submenu. It also automatically detects your database table, creates it, adds it to the menu, and creates an administration page for it with pagination. With just one step, you can create your plugin: rename the framework folder, not even the main .php file of the plugin. This is by far the quickest plugin generator to deploy and the only framework with so many functions, allowing you to use multiple copies of it on the same WordPress without any collisions.
