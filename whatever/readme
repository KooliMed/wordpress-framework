== Installation ==

To create your own plugin(s) based on this framework:
- Copy the content of this folder inside a new folder that has the name of your desired plugin name (no space, no uppercase). That's all!
IMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE THE PHP FILES NAMES, DO NOT EDIT THE CLASSES AND TRAITS NAMES, JUST PUT THE CONTENT IN A NEW FOLDER.

Once on the wp admin plugin page, activate your plugin even if it has the old framework name (whatever, or another copy with any name of whatever). Don't worry if you don't see your plugin name at first. The framework will disable the old copy and make all the necessary changes.

== Notice ==

You can define your plugin main menu name from the main plugin file, replacing the one in the comment.
For ex:
/*
   Plugin Name: Whatever
   Main Menu: Whatever Settings <<<<<< change this to change the default main menu.
